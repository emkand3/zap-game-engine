# zap-game-engine
A personal game engine made using the Pygame library.

This game engine consists of multiple different engines, including actor, physics, play, sound, utility, ui, and sound. Using these engines, I created three different games:

1. Cannon Fodder
   - Cannon fodder was created to demonstrate the physics engine of the game, along with some moving parts of the stage using various different geometry.

2. Hangman
   - Hangman was created to demonstrate the drawing of shapes, along with gathering user input during the project.

3. Fall Game Jam
   - This game was created for a club game jam themed around 'Fall', in which you must catch falling leaves as they spawn at the top of the screen and fall to the bottom. If you catch them before they hit the bottom of the stage, you gain a point.
